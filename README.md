# AutoGraphicDesign

This package is intended to read a news url and summarise it using `newspaper3k`. The title is then sent to `Drawbot` to create a simple design created by me.

Before using the code, install every package in requirements.txt using `pip install`

To use this package, do:

```bash
python main.py https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/01/hong-kong-democracy-activists-jailed-for-assembly-in-2019-protests
```
