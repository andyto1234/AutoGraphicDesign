# Hong Kong News Summary Design Tool

## Introduction
This package is intended to read a news url and summarise it using `newspaper3k`. The title is then sent to `Drawbot` to create a simple design created by me.

## Installation
Before using the code, install every package in requirements.txt using `pip install`

## How to Use
To use this package, do:

```bash
python main.py https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/01/hong-kong-democracy-activists-jailed-for-assembly-in-2019-protests
```

## To Do
- [ ] Create text file database
- [ ] Auto-fetch news websites
- [ ] Create telegram bot for ease of use
- [ ] Create chrome extension
- [ ] Create app support

## Final Message
> Due to the new National Security Law, HongKongers have sadly lost the ability to express their views. Protesters could be easily jailed for >10 years... Please continue to #FightForFreedom and #StandWithHongKong.
